Dear teachers,

Good afternoon! It is my great honor to participate in the postgraduate re-examination of your esteemed university. My name is Wang Zichao, and I am 22 years old. I come from the beautiful Yulin City, Shaanxi Province. I majored in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Xi'an University of Science and Technology during my undergraduate studies. I have a solid programming foundation and rich experience in scientific research and practical activities. Next, I will make a self-statement from four aspects: personal experience, scientific research and innovation, motivation for further study, and future plans.

First of all, in terms of personal experience, I have always maintained a positive, enterprising, and passionate attitude towards life, constantly learning. During my undergraduate years, I conscientiously completed all the courses, systematically mastering core courses such as Data Structure and Algorithm Design and Analysis, and independently expanding my knowledge in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. In addition to my academic studies, I also joined the Sports Department of the college and the Fenglai Guitar Club of the university. During this period, I was awarded the titles of Excellent Communist Youth League Member, Excellent Student Cadre, and Excellent Individual during the military training. What makes me feel most proud is that during the COVID-19 pandemic, I actively participated in the anti-pandemic activities and received a certificate of Outstanding Young Anti-pandemic Volunteer issued by the school. Just like Comrade Lei Feng, I did what I could to contribute and shine.

Secondly, in terms of scientific research and competitions, Einstein once said that interest is the best teacher. Since my high school days, I have had a strong interest in coding. At the beginning of my university life, I learned about the Software Innovation Laboratory of Xi'an University of Science and Technology. So, by self-studying the C programming language, I successfully passed the recruitment assessment of the laboratory. After joining the laboratory, I began to study professional knowledge assiduously and improve my professional skills. I made continuous progress in the monthly elimination assessments and grew under pressure. Here, I would like to borrow a sentence from Tim, the CEO of Studio Moonshot: "Infinite Progress", which will also serve as my life motto. During my study in the laboratory, my professional abilities have been greatly improved. I have mastered programming languages such as C, C++, and JavaScript, and have taken a small step in the field of front-end development. At the same time, I have achieved excellent completion of a provincial-level project in the National College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, won the second prize in the Northwest Division of the National Computer Design Competition, the third prize in the National "Zhengda Cup" Hackathon, and a bronze medal in the finals of the 2023 Global AI Big Data Competition. Moreover, I successfully led my team to win a bronze medal in the regional competition of ACM, the highest event in computer algorithms. Later, I became the monitor of the laboratory and the leader of the front-end group. I regularly organized algorithm competitions and professional training sessions within the laboratory to pass on the laboratory's culture and professional knowledge, making more students interested in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science, and making a modest contribution to building China into a computer powerhouse.

Then, regarding my reasons for pursuing a master's degree, I once had an internship experience at Tencent Cloud. During the internship, I found that I still had many shortcomings and lacked the reserve of professional knowledge, which was not enough to satisfy my curiosity and research in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science. Therefore, I choose to pursue a master's degree to further study and improve my professional level in the computer field.

Finally, if I am fortunate enough to study for a master's degree at your university, I will study all the courses seriously, read extensively in my spare time to expand my professional knowledge reserve and lay a foundation for further study. In addition, I will keep learning, seek guidance from teachers, and make my own contributions to the vertical and horizontal research projects of my supervisors, and follow their suggestions.

That's all for my self-introduction. Thank you, teachers!
